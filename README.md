# Events pattern matcher
Describe the pattern and match it agains a sequence of events (works kind of like regexps for strings).

## Purpose
This package is intended to use to analyze users behaviour in any given system (app or website) based on the events they trigger while working with the system.

While the most complex and in-depth analysis is best done with SQL queries and Python-like calculations, this package aims to help to make assumptions and validate them against given sequences of events.

## Applications
The idea of this package is to help answer questions like:
1. Do users use search tool before buying on the website?
2. How many articles new user reads before making his first comment?
3. How many times user visit website between first and second purchases?

*Any assumption that can be described in terms of events sequence, can be validated with this tool.*
